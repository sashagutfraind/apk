2015-11-29
---------------------------
changes
- improved recruitment code
- more informed stats

Completed Testing:
- very strong recruitment ultimately wipes out HCV
- doses are counted correctly
- adherence=0 leads to lots of treatment, but no decline in prevalence
- one acute person goes through all key stages of the disease
- one chronic person goes through all key stages of the disease

known problems:
-agents are not clickable in GUI


2015-10-15
---------------------------
changes
- treatment
- multiple enrollment to treatment is possible in parallel
- enrollment selection is also much faster


2015-01-09
---------------------------
changes
-better stats
-parameter mean_career_duration was renamed in the paper to
mean_time_to_cessation

2014-08-20
---------------------------
changes

bug fixes
- immunology error
- support for true reciprocity

2014-06-13
---------------------------
changes
- changed how the age of arriving agents is set

bug fixes
- corrected failure to report status for late-arriving agents 
- stop reporting status from dead agents (ZIP=null)

2014-05-06
---------------------------
changes
- mature installer
- new features in the GUI

fixes
- aging bug


2014-04-06
---------------------------
changes
- support for burn-in mode
- fixed installer
- synthetic data generator

fixes
- burn-in explicitly allows infections


2014-02-23
---------------------------
changes
- support for entry with infectious state
- syringe source attribute
- generation of gap population
- annual reporting of status for all agents

fixes
- missed return of drug out degree
- incorrect comparison with Double.NaN: now using "... Double.isNaN(v);"
- incorrect generation of newly arriving IDUs.

2013-11-29
---------------------------
changes
- bug traps
- rewamped recording of events
- tested integration with synth population in batch and gui mode
- support for 5 distinct drug markets
- improved parameter handling
- parameters distinguish acute time for naive and rechallenged

fixes
- fixed incorrect handling of incarceration, leading to high infections
- IDUs generated during the course of the simulation did not have HCV_state==susceptible.
- minor bug in randomization for PersonGenerator
- errors with masking of parameter error by a default value
- correct a problem with classifier of HCV (RandomForest) due to insufficient number of trees, leading to swings in prevalence

2013-9-02
---------------------------
changes
- migration to Repast Simphony 2.1
- faster handling of links
- preliminary support for synthetic agents with APK-Synth

fixes
- agent color is now indicative of their HCV status.


2013-6-26
---------------------------
changes
- mortality and tie attrition are now given in years, instead of ticks.

fixes
- parameters for mortality and tie lifetime were not passed to the IDU class.  
- make sure that chronic cases cannot be reinfected (unlike resistant)


2013-5-29
---------------------------
new
* more safe storage of IDU attributes
* gender differences in self-clearance rates
* more detailed event stats
* parameters to control various internals:
	probability of acute and chronic in AB test is +
	interaction rates

fixes
* correct support for multiple runs
* getZip() exception

2013-02-19
---------------------------
new
* improved color scheme
* removed csv library
* new batch mode
* support for run length parameter
* detailed validation
* support for serialization

fixes
* fixed estimation of zone population
* fixed frequency of call to linking

known problem
* getZip() fails intermittently 



2012-12-31
---------------------------
new
* improved color scheme

fixes
* fixed estimation of zone population
